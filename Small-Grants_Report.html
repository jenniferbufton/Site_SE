<p>We can also look at a number of environmental indicators that impact on the communities that the funding is targeting. The Index of Multiple Deprivation is the aggregate of all the different indicators (Crime, Employment, etc.), and this Index gives a relative score of deprivation in a locale.</p>
<p><br />
The project in the most deprived area (Blackpool ) is titled “Football Fans in Training”, and was awarded £9,798.00</p>
